App componet is the Root component of app.

All the html code will be placed at component html and css at component css files.

All the static asserts i.e,Images will be placed at asserts folder.

Componennts:
--------------

App component Will be created by default Whenever we create a project using ng new command.

App component Will always be the Prarent component.If we create any other component it will become the child component.

we can create a component using ng g component componentName

we can add the child component where we want by wrapping the selector in component.ts file with tag and place where we want.

Routing:
--------
In angular we can navigate between pages,that is known as routing
 
for Routing
 
1.frist we need import router module from angular in main or root component(i.e,in app.module.ts in App component).

i.e,import { RouterModule} from '@angular/router'

2.RouterModule has forRoot,the forRoot takes array of objects,Each objects takes path and the componet.
 Path is the name of the router or extended Url and component is the name of the class, i.e., the component created.

i.e,RouterModule.forRoot([

         {
             
	path: '',
             
	component: HomeComponent
          
	},
	{
            
	path: 'docs',
            
	component: DocsComponent
        
	},

        {

        path: 'project',

        component: ProjectComponent
 
        }

    ])

3.Default Route:
At satarting the path is empty.that means that is a default route.


4.Now the path will added where ever we want,i.e,on a tag or etc.,...

i.e,<button  class="learning"  type="button" name="button">
     
	 <a routerLink="docs">Get Started</a>

    </button>

    <button  class="project"  type="button" name="button">

      <a routerLink="project">Sample Project</a>

    </button>

5.Now we place a router outlet tag where we want to display that component for the particular path.
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
